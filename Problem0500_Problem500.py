# a byte in computer terms. Each power of 2 adds another
#bit to the byte. 2^1   2^2   2^4   2^8
# we then already have 2^3 = on divisors of 2^1 and 2^2
# or 2^7 = divisors of 2^1 2^2 2^4  4+2+1=7
# so take least numbers of the first 500500 primes
# with each one raised to incremental powers of 2

#all numbers are of the form p1^a1  * p2^a2 * p3^a3
# this gives least number .
#the trick i missed above is seeing that the number of
#terms to get 2^500500 divisors is to still keep
#500500 terms. And look at it like each one is either
